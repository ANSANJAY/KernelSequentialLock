# Kernel Sequential Lock Exploration 🗝️🐧

Delve into the mechanics, applications, and subtle aspects of using Sequential Locks (seqlocks) in the Linux Kernel. From understanding the 'Why' to exploring real-time use-cases and dealing with preemption, limitations, and interrupts, this repository is a treasure trove for aspiring Kernel developers and enthusiasts! 🚀👨‍💻

## Repository Structure 🏗️📂

- **0_why_sequence_lock**: Understand the necessity behind using seqlocks.
- **1_sequence locks**: An overview of sequence locks and their fundamental concept.
- **2_how it works**: Delving deeper into seqlocks' working mechanism with example code (`hello.c`).
- **3_writer**: Discussing write operations using seqlocks.
- **4_reader**: Exploring read operations and their implementation through seqlocks.
